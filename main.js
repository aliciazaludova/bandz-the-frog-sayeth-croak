        bio: "It was what most would call a perfect day.  The sun emblazened it's magnificence on to the landscape below, animals enchantingly sang their songs of joy, a picturesque picnic lunch was strewn across a checkered blanket, and two lovers intertwined below a willow tree.  As the earth and all her creatures were distracted and drenched in euphoria their paradise was being overthrown. A silence grasped the lovers with paranormal force, their lips turned cold as they realized what they had done.  Their act had consumated a creature so vicious and so powerful that when she was born her perfectly pitched cries melted faces and eclipsed the moon with blood.",
